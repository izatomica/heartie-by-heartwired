# Quick Reference: The 3-Layer Framework

> One-page summary of Heartwired's core philosophy

## The Key Insight

**You can't write effective content (Layer 3) without knowing your voice and channels (Layer 2). You can't choose channels without knowing who you're talking to (Layer 1). Most marketing fails because people skip layers.**

Most solopreneurs jump straight to tactics (posting, emailing, creating content) without the strategic foundation. They're busy but not effective. Heartwired fixes this by guiding users to build from the bottom up.

## The 7 Strategic Categories

```
LAYER 1: BRAND STRATEGY (Foundation)
├── 🎯 Your Customer      - Who you're really talking to
├── 📍 Your Position      - What makes you different
└── 💬 Your Messaging     - The words that connect

LAYER 2: MARKETING STRATEGY (Approach)
├── ✍️  Your Voice        - How you sound (tone, style, personality)
├── 🌍 Your Reality       - Your actual constraints (time, budget, energy)
└── 🗺️  Your Landscape    - Where your audience hangs out, competitors

LAYER 3: MARKETING PLAN (Execution)
├── 🚀 Your Big Plans     - Quarterly goals, launches, campaigns
├── 📅 Calendar           - Scheduled activities
└── ✅ Activities         - Individual content pieces
```

## Layer Colors

```css
--layer-1: #7A2D4D;        /* Brand Strategy (Burgundy) - foundation */
--layer-2: #1B6B6B;        /* Marketing Strategy (Teal) - bridge */
--layer-3: #5A9A6B;        /* Marketing Plan (Sage) - execution */
```

## The "Aha Moment"

**Before Heartwired:**
"I'm posting every day but nothing's working."

**After understanding the framework:**
"Oh! I was doing Layer 3 without Layer 1. No wonder my content felt random."
