## The Heartie Promise

**Before Heartie:**
"I'm posting every day on three platforms and sending emails but I have no idea if it's working. I feel like I'm throwing spaghetti at the wall. I'm exhausted."

**With Heartie:**
"I understand my marketing strategy now. I know who I'm talking to, where to show up, and what to say. My content has purpose. I feel confident and in control."

**The Transformation:**
Overwhelmed → Confident
Random → Strategic
Reactive → Intentional
Scattered → Focused
